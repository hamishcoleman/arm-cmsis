Collected together from the various public releases, this repository
contains the ARM CMSIS codebase.  This is the ARM library that is used
to compile software to run on bare-metal ARM microcontrollers.

The releases contained here do not appear to have a public
repository.  However, starting from v4.3.0, there is a repo at
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS and the new v5 release of CMSIS
is also being developed with a public repo.
