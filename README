This is a compilation of the public releases of the ARM CMSIS-Core
software from the time that it was released with an open licence (either
BSD or zlib) until the CMSIS software was released as a git repository.
It contains commits for versions 3.2, 4.0, 4.01 and 4.2

This is the ARM library that is used to compile software to run on
bare-metal ARM microcontrollers.

The releases contained here do not appear to have a public
repository.  However, starting from v4.3.0, there is a repo at
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS and the new v5 release of CMSIS
is also being developed with a public repo.
